# Anthology CTM

This repository is the archive for **Anthology**, a series of Complete the Monument (CTM) maps for modern Minecraft created by Joey Sweener. 

The Anthology series is my attempt at evoking that classic feeling of CTM maps from Minecraft's heyday, while making tasteful use of current functionality like datapacks to elevate the experience without overwhelming the player. A particular focus of the series is to use gameplay and mechanics as a framework for storytelling, similar to traditional tabletop roleplaying environments like Dungeons and Dragons (one of the core datapack mechanics is rolling dice in the background!). 

More to come. Stay tuned.
