# Anthology CTM

This repository is the archive for **Anthology**, a series of Complete the Monument (CTM) maps for modern Minecraft created by Joey Sweener. 

The Anthology series is my attempt at evoking the feeling of classic CTM maps of Minecraft's heyday, while making tasteful use of modern tools like resource and datapacks to elevate the experience without overwhelming the player with hundreds of unique items, mobs, etc. A particular focus of the series is to use gameplay and mechanics as a framework for storytelling, similar to traditional tabletop roleplaying environments like Dungeons and Dragons (one of the core datapack mechanics is rolling dice!). 

More to come. Stay tuned.
